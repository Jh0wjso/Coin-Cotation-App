# CoinCotation

This app is used to look for cryptocurrency quotes and information about them, in this app we receive information and data from the Bitcoin and CoinGecko Market APIs. In the future, I think that this app will focus on buying and selling cryptocurrencies, and be a social network for people who are interested in and work with cryptocurrency investing.This app was made using react native, the app take the data from Mercado BitCoin API, is a generic app, a basic app, the app deserver for the user search a crypto and see all infos about her, like cotatation, volume and more.
